"Folio from a manuscript of Mu'nis al-ahrar fi daqa 'iq al-ash'ar (The Free Men's Companion to the Subtleties of Poems) by Muhammad ibn Badr al-Din Jajarmi: Treasurer, money changer, courier and jeweler; tent, pavilion, drum, and banner; lion, onager, wolf, sheep, partridge and hawk",Muhammad ibn Badr Jajarmi,1341,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:51538_dynmc,,2731.35
Illustrated Manuscript of Layla and Majnun by Hamdi,Unknown Artist,c. 1579,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC102348_dynmc,"This is a small illustrated copy of Hamdi’s Layla and Majnun. Hamdi (d. 1503) was an Ottoman poet who wrote his Layla and Majnun in Turkish in 1499 after the famous Persian work of Jami with the same title. In fact Hamdi references in his own poetry Hatifi, the nephew of Jami who also composed a Layla and Majnun in Persian. Although this copy is not dated, notes added to the empty space at the beginning of the manuscript by the same hand who copied the rest of the manuscript include poems dedicated to Sokollu Mehmed Pasha’s death in 987 H/1579. The manuscript was therefore copied in or around 1579 and it may have been planned for this Pasha who was the grand vizier at that time. The square and oval shaped seals on the first and second folios must have belonged to later but unidentified owners.
The manuscript has 123 folios copied in two columns and 17 lines of nastaliq script. There is a small illuminated panel at the beginning of the text and seven illustrations spread to the entirety of the manuscript on folios 14r, 22v, 39v, 46v, 50v, 108v, and 110r. Although the relationship between the text and the illustrations is strong the painter uses his Ottoman context to depict a story that takes place in an Arab desert. The last folio which may have contained an original colophon has been replaced by another one. The lacquer binding is not original and probably belonged to a Qajar manuscript of late 18th century from Iran. Most likely the doublures (inner side of the covers) have been reversed to serve as the outside covers.

The subject of the illustrations are:
14r:  Majnun disguised as a blind beggar comes to Layla’s house.
22v: Majnun’s father visits Layla’s father to marry his son to Layla.
39v: Layla and her friends enjoy the countryside on a spring day. 
46v:  Majnun sees the battle between his tribe and Layla's.
50v: The end of the battle 
108v: After Layla’s invitation Majnun happily goes to her and all the animals in the desert follow him. 
110r: The lovers are reunited under the tent.

The goddess is frontal, wearing a straight wig, parted in the center, and bound with straight ribbons. Her triangle shaped face is flat with wide-set eyes, broad cheeks, and a flat chin. Her characteristically cow-shaped ears are rendered as flat on either side of the wig. Below her face is a round broad collar with a simple pattern of tube and drop beads. On each of her shoulder sits a uraeus, the upright rearing cobra, holding a sun-disk on its head.  A molded cornice above the goddess’ head holds the lower part of the architectural frame of the naos, or temple, within which sits a uraeus. The main part of the naos, which would have extended upwards to form the remainder of the structure, is now lost. The emblem would have been attached to a handle, also lost, that may have included inscriptions to a pharaoh.",8035.12

The text in Azeri Turkish concerns the hardships endured by Prophet Muhammad and his family, especially his grandsons' death in Karbala, Iraq where the author Fuzuli was from. The manuscript is copied in 19 lines of naskh on 167 folios. There are notes and description of miniatures in Turkish in a later hand. There are four paintings:
1) 67v: Hasan and Husayn mourn as their father Ali is struck down by Ibn Muljan.
2) 77r: The poisoning of Hasan. 
3) 100v: Young martyrs, Hasan and Husayn, hold up their heads after decapitation at the hands of the military governor of Kufa in 680.
4)145r: Devotion paid to the horse of martyr Husayn upon its return to camp.
All the miniatures are text block size and horizontal ones force the viewer to turn the book for better viewing.

Enjoyed among court circles, the Ottoman sultan Murad III (r. 1574-1595) commissioned a multi-volume imperial copy with 814 illustrations in the 1590s. It was expertly copied and illustrated by Ottoman court artists. This scene depicts the Prophet at a feast with his companions during military campaigns around the port city of Yanbu, in present-day Saudi Arabia. In the miniature following 16th century norms, the face of the Prophet is covered and the flaming halo around his body indicates his prophetic status. The artist chose contemporary Ottoman details, such as blue-and-white ceramic dishes and gilded tableware along with architectural details, to visualize the actual setting of the event that took place in 623.",2166.1

The manuscript is copied in 19 lines of naskh on 167 folios. There are notes and description of miniatures in Turkish in a later hand. There are four paintings:
1) 67v: Hasan and Husayn mourn as their father Ali is struck down by Ibn Muljan.
2) 77r: The poisoning of Hasan. 
3) 100v: Young martyrs, Hasan and Husayn, hold up their heads after decapitation at the hands of the military governor of Kufa in 680.
4)145r: Devotion paid to the horse of martyr Husayn upon its return to camp.
All the miniatures are text block size and horizontal ones force the viewer to turn the book for better viewing. Although the mosque depiction on the first miniature suggests an Ottoman context, the illustrative style, the colors of the miniatures, especially lilac and orange, and the overall quality of the manuscript suggest that it was not produced in the palace workshops.",8571.32

Double-sided Hathor Emblem from a Sistrum,Unknown Artist,664 BCE-343 BCE,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:764531,"This double-sided emblem of the cow-eared, Egyptian goddess Hathor comes from a sistrum or ceremonial rattle. The goddess is frontal, wearing a straight wig, parted in the center, and bound with straight ribbons. Her triangle shaped face is flat with wide-set eyes, broad cheeks, and a flat chin. Her characteristically cow-shaped ears are rendered as flat on either side of the wig. Below her face is a round broad collar with a simple pattern of tube and drop beads. On each of her shoulder sits a uraeus, the upright rearing cobra, holding a sun-disk on its head.  A molded cornice above the goddess’ head holds the lower part of the architectural frame of the naos, or temple, within which sits a uraeus. The main part of the naos, which would have extended upwards to form the remainder of the structure, is now lost. The emblem would have been attached to a handle, also lost, that may have included inscriptions to a pharaoh.",7134.2

Illustrated Manuscript of the Divan of Baki,Unknown Artist,1590-1600,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:huam:DDC112565_dynmc,"This manuscript of the Divan of Baki is copied in nastaliq script on more than 70 folios with 17 lines and 2 columns per page.  Baki (1526-1600) was an Ottoman poet and his Turkish divan (collected works) is composed of lyric odes (ghazals).  The beginning of this manuscript seems to be missing as other copies of Baki’s divan include odes dedicated to Sultan Suleyman I, Selim II and Murad III, under whom the poet Baki flourished, as well as the leading dignitaries such as the grand vizier, or the seyhulislam. The manuscript contains seven paintings displaying a close text and image relationship. Most of the poems end with verses addressed to Baki himself.  In four paintings, the poet Baki himself is depicted as an old man with an aquiline nose and gray beard wearing a large turban, most likely revealing his real life qualities.   
Illustrated folios:
6r: Baki compares himself to Farhad at carving stones of tribulation with his poetry
29v: Baki compares the stature of the youth to a cypress tree.
32r: Baki writes about dancing and pleasure.
42r: A man opens his chest to the arrows of a young man.
44v: Baki is served wine in a gathering in a garden.
47v: Two young men drink wine.
62: This folio is now loose and based on the catchwords and the text contained on it, it most likely belonged to the beginning of the manuscript. The painting depicts a historical event: The ten year old Safavid prince Haydar Mirza was sent to Istanbul from Qazvin in 1590 as a guarantor of peace between the Safavids and the Ottomans who had been at war since 1578. The poet Baki included an ode about this event to Murad III.
