Bamboo through the Four Seasons,Yu Tŏk-chang (also known as Su-un and Ka-san-ŭng),mid 18th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:51495_dynmc,"Korean folding screens often have six panels, like those painted in Japan; more characteristically, however, Korean screens boast eight, ten, or even twelve panels. In some cases, a Korean screen may feature a single, unified composition that spreads across all its panels; in other instances--such as this one--each panel is conceived as an individual painting.

Representing bamboo through the four seasons, this eight-panel screen is meant to be ""read"" by the viewer from right to left. The first two paintings, at the far right, depict newly sprung shoots and fresh stalks of bamboo emerging from the ground in spring. The next pair of images display lush, hearty stalks of bamboo enduring the strong winds and warm sun of summer. The relative sparseness, dry ink tones, and overlapping mist visible in the next two paintings convey characteristics of the autumn months. The last pair of images, at the far left, which depict old, thick, broken stalks of bamboo with hints of new stalks in one painting and bamboo branches heavily laden with snow in the other, complete the cycle with the winter season. Though the paintings lack inscriptions and signatures, two red, square seal impressions at the upper left corner of the far--left panel identify two sobriquets of the artist Yu Tŏk-chang (1675-1765) and thus reveal the creator of this masterful work of art.

A follower of the famous Korean bamboo-painting master Yi Chŏng (1541-1622), Yu Tŏk-chang was one of the most prominent literati artists of the Chosŏn dynasty (1392-1910). Like their Koryŏ-dynasty (918-1392) predecessors, both Yi and Yu took inspiration from the work of Chinese literati painters of the Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1279-1368) dynasties. Their paintings thus tend to resemble literati paintings by early Chinese masters, rather than works produced by their Chinese contemporaries. In this screen, however, Yu departs from the Chinese model and exhibits the distinctly Korean style of bamboo painting he learned from Yi Chŏng: the two tones of ink used to starkly distinguish fore-and background subjects; the angular mists that abruptly interrupt a scene; and the thick stumps of bamboo with sharp, broken edges. 

Bamboo painting was extremely popular among the literati, perhaps because of its association with the so-called Four Gentlemen--plum blossoms, orchids, chrysanthemums, and bamboo. All four of these botanical subjects, which readily lend themselves to depiction with calligraphic brushwork, are said to embody the virtues to which Confucian scholars aspired, such as integrity, purity, and strength in the face of adversity. So important was the ability to paint bamboo that in the fifteenth century it outranked even landscape painting in the official examinations for Korea's royal painting academy.

"Blossoming Branch of an Old, Weathered Plum Tree",Unknown Artist,17th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:71986_dynmc,"Because it blooms in winter, even before it dons its leaves and while snow and ice still cover the ground, the Chinese flowering plum (Prunus mume) became a symbol of purity and of strength in the face of adversity; as such, it was popular as both a literary and an artistic motif in China, Korea, and Japan. The plum, together with the orchid, the chrysanthemum, and the bamboo (three other botanical subjects imbued with symbolic Confucian meaning and conducive to depiction with a calligraphy brush and ink), came to be known as the ""Four Gentlemen.""

In this delicately rendered painting, the old blossoming plum tree appears almost as if enveloped in mist and shrouded in silvery moonlight. Unlike the rugged, expressive ink plum paintings by Cho Hŭi-ryong (1791-1859), the emphasis in this work is on suggestive description and delicate brushwork-characteristics typical of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Korean paintings of plum blossoms.

The wear and slight damage along the right edge of this painting, combined with absence of damage along the left vertical edge, suggest that it was once part of a folding screen. In that context, it is possible that the painting was salvaged from a damaged screen and subsequently mounted as a hanging scroll. One can imagine that the painting originally was one of six or eight panels, each of which represented an old plum tree.

Kingfisher Over a Lotus Pond,Ren Yi 任頤,late 19th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:78690_dynmc,"Ren Yi (also known by his sobriquet Bonian) was born in Shangyin (modern Shaoxing), Zhejiang province. The son of a portrait painter, Ren Yi learned to paint at a young age and in adulthood used his art as his livelihood. After living for a time in Ningbo and Suzhou, Ren finally settled in the newly developed port city of Shanghai in 1868. From his base in bustling Shanghai, Ren Yi developed a new and novel style of painting that won him a wide audience and made him the acknowledged leader of the Shanghai school, or Haipai. Though it favors light colors, Ren's style is at once bold, forceful, and vivid, as exemplified by this delightful bird-and-flower painting.

Depicting a small bird with outstretched wings darting through the attenuated stems of lotus growing in a pond, this painting adopts a perspective that brings the viewer down to the water's surface, virtually eye-to-eye with the tiny creature. The broad, blue-green lotus leaves and lush white blossoms appear enormous as they loom above the bird, while a thick forest of lotus stems nearly camouflages it altogether. Faint brush strokes representing water reeds and grasses delineate the pond's surface, which would otherwise appear as a void.

The lotus is an important motif in Chinese art that traces its symbolic origins to Buddhism. Because it grows in muddy waters, yet emerges upright, unsullied, fragrant, and beautiful, the lotus became an emblem of purity in Buddhist literature and imagery. The two Chinese terms for lotus--lian and he--are phonetically identical to numerous auspicious phrases, such as love and harmony, and are thus ubiquitous in Chinese folk art and rebuses.

Red Painting,Joseph Marioni,1999,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:60684_dynmc,"The painting is a large, vertical plane of deep mahogany red-brown acrylic, painted in two distinct layers of thick and thinly applied acrylic, beginning with a stain of dark, ""Benzimidazo"" brown, which acts as a primer. Its outer surface of ""Azoic plum brown"" appears tactile and shiny, almost sticky. The layers vary visibly in tonality and density and the plum brown surface begins to gather into extended drips that coalesce in a series of parallel rivulets about halfway down the picture plane; towards the bottom center, it pools into a series of more marked gullies and ridges, pulling apart like a painterly fjord, and lifting, like a skirt, to reveal the stain below. The acrylic also shrinks in along some of the edges, gaining thickness as it does so, and these effects, along with the implied flow of the medium , the ""breathing room"" between the layers, and its orientation and scale, serve to give the painting an anthropomorphic, object quality. The painting entreats one to interact with it as a whole object/image, and not as a picture of assorted forms or things or parts; it also gains considerably when viewed in daylight. The title, ""Red Painting 1999 No. 4"", 1999, refers to the fact that this is the fourthpainting executed by Marioni in 1999. It is part of a set of four paintings executed in anticipation of the Fogg’s selection of one, and intended to ""show the range of Marioni’s approaches to his monochromes.""",5089.06
"Old Weathered Plum Tree with Spring Blossoms, in the Manner of the Chinese Painter Wu Zhen (1280-1354)",Cho Hŭi-ryong,mid-19th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:71985_dynmc,"This plum-blossom painting is an expressive combination of balanced contrasts: soft, rounded plum blossoms and buds delicately rest on sharp branches that burst in every direction; watery ink washes are punctuated with black dots scattered along the image. 

The vertical crease that runs down the center of this plum-blossom painting indicates that it was once part of an accordion-fold album. Now mounted as a hanging scroll, the painting is believed to have originated from an album of sixteen leaves, all by the same artist. The four-character inscription at the lower right of this painting reads Mae-do-in chak (Chinese, Meidaoren zuo), which might be translated ""Made by Mae-do-in"" or ""Made by the Plum Daoist."" While it would seem an entirely appropriate phrase for Cho Hŭi-ryong, Meidaoren is in fact a hao, or sobriquet, of the renowned fourteenth-century Chinese ink plum painter Wu Zhen (1280-1354). Thus, these four characters are not a signature of Cho Hŭi-ryong; rather, they indicate that in painting this album leaf, Cho imitated the style of Wu Zhen. The rugged, expressive brushwork, however, not only marks the painting as a nineteenth-century work, but distinguishes it from paintings done in earlier centuries, which typically would have attempted a more naturalistic depiction using more delicate and descriptive brushwork.

Portrait of a Youth,Unknown Artist,mid 19th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:789233,"The composition of this portrait study was first outlined in pencil and then blocked out with fields of watercolor, as is evidenced in the sitter’s chair. Next, the artist added opaque watercolor in layers, using fine lines and stippling to replicate the designs and textures of fabrics, most prominently those of the young man’s patterned coat and its gray fur trim. In contrast to his brightly colored clothing, his face is generally pallid, but blues beneath his chin and mouth suggest the hint of a beard. The play on near monochrome is continued in the silhouetted, inky locks that frame his face and give way to a tall black hat. The subject’s position in the composition and aspects of painterly execution such as the modeling of his face and hands suggest that the image was based at least in part on a photograph, a practice common among Qajar artists from the mid-nineteenth century onward, photography having been introduced in Iran in the 1840s. The painting reflects the “new realism” introduced by Abu'l-Hasan Ghaffari, also known as Sani' al-Mulk, in the middle years of the nineteenth century, during the reign of Nasir al-Din Shah (r. 1848–96), and disseminated by his contemporaries. Ghaffari’s work combined physiognomic likeness with the psychology of the subject to produce an often intense pictorial effect—a “real” presence—undiminished by rich decorative details, which in some artists’ hands might emphasize surface at the expense of illusionistic volume and depth. Although this portrait lacks the overall impact of a work by Ghaffari, it demonstrates its painter’s participation in what was new at the time.
On the lower right side of the sheet, a barely visible inscription, which reads, tasvvr-i dukhtar-i Shahrukh (depiction [by] the daughter of Shahrukh), is tantalizing because it suggests a female artist.

Orchid and Rock,Kim Ŭng-wŏn (also spelled Gim Eung'won; also known as So-ho and Ch'ŏn-ram),late 19th-early 20th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:71981_dynmc,"An important painter and calligrapher of the late Chosŏn period, Kim Ŭng-wŏn is best remembered for his depictions of orchids, which he painted in the manner of the nineteenth-century master Prince Yi Ha-ŭng. (A magnificent screen by Prince Yi Ha-ŭng is featured in this gallery's glass-fronted screen case.) A professor of painting and calligraphy at the Institute of Arts in Seoul, Kim was also one of the founders of the Painting and Calligraphy Association, established in 1918. 

The orchid, a symbol of loyalty and personal integrity, held a fascination for literati painters, since its grasslike leaves and delicate, simple flowers lent themselves to depiction with calligraphic brushwork. Chinese artists had begun to paint the orchid during the Song dynasty (960-1279), the subject becoming ever more popular in the succeeding Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. By the eighteenth century, the taste for paintings of orchids had spread to Korea, where these works enjoyed considerable vogue in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. 

Chinese and Korean artists typically paired orchids and rocks, the orchids coaxing the artist to employ his most delicate, curvilinear brushwork, the rocks tempting him to present his most forceful and expressionistic brushwork. The inscription on this painting translates as:

While sitting quietly, I sense a subtle fragrance.
Such subtlety exists only between reality and imagination.

Untitled,Rudolf de Crignis,1999,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:71931_dynmc,"The canvas has several layers of white gesso, each of which is sanded to achieve a smooth ground. The artist applies the gesso ground around the outer edges of the stretcher, so that the painted surface appears to be floating on a smooth white porcelain block. He applies color in thin layers of glaze, like so many veils. As many as 40 layers of glaze are built up over a period of several weeks. Laying down even, continuous brushstrokes in alternating layers of vertical and horizontal orientations, he creates a subtle grid pattern. The artist often applies one or more colors in addition to blue -- in this case, 6-8 layers of cinnabar green at different depths (traces of which can be seen around the edges of the painting). Layers of ultramarine in combination with royal blue (a mixture of ultramarine and titanium white) make the other colors vibrate, acting ""as a catalyst to bring the involved colors into spacious movement on the top of the surface."" (See artist's statement in object file.) The surface texture is purely the result of brushwork, which creates a structural discipline that interacts with the expansive dematerialized sensuality of blue.

Orchids and Rocks,Yi Ha-ŭng (also known as Taewŏn’gun),dated early autumn 1892,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:51772_dynmc,"A royal prince, Yi Ha-ŭng was the father of King Ko-chong (r. 1864-1906), the last king of the Chosŏn dynasty (1392-1910). In addition to being an enlightened statesman, Yi was an accomplished painter and calligrapher who was unsurpassed in his mastery of orchid painting. Frequently depicted in literati paintings alongside rocks and boulders, the orchid appears graceful, elegant, and unaffected by its rough surroundings. The orchids and rocks in Yi's paintings typically enter the composition at dramatic angles and generally occupy only one corner or one side of a composition. 

Korean folding screens often have six panels, like those painted in Japan; more characteristically, however, Korean screens boast eight, ten, or even twelve panels. In some cases, a Korean screen may feature a single, unified composition that spreads across all its panels; in other instances--such as this one--each panel is conceived as an individual painting. The ten separate paintings that compose this screen are grouped in four pairs, with an individual composition mounted on the first and last panels of the screen. Each of the four pairs in the middle can be read as a single composition or as two separate paintings. Such visual double entendres held a special allure for Korean literati artists of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. This screen's large size and its royal authorship indicate that it was painted for one of the royal palaces.

Each painting bears a personal seal of the artist, rather than a seal with the artist's name or sobriquet. For example, the seal in the lower right corner of the ninth panel (second from the left) translates into the aphorism ""The best time to view a flower is when it is half open."" The other nine personal seal impressions vary from idiomatic phrases to humorous remarks on Daoism and Buddhism. In the very last panel at the far left, however, Yi Ha-ŭng signs and impresses two of his artist's seals to the painting, making the authorship of this important screen indisputable. His inscription translates as, ""Done by the seventy-three-year-old old man Sŏk-p'a in the early autumn of 1892.""

"Blossoming Branch of an Old, Weathered Plum Tree",Unknown Artist,17th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:71986_dynmc,"Because it blooms in winter, even before it dons its leaves and while snow and ice still cover the ground, the Chinese flowering plum (Prunus mume) became a symbol of purity and of strength in the face of adversity; as such, it was popular as both a literary and an artistic motif in China, Korea, and Japan. The plum, together with the orchid, the chrysanthemum, and the bamboo (three other botanical subjects imbued with symbolic Confucian meaning and conducive to depiction with a calligraphy brush and ink), came to be known as the ""Four Gentlemen.""

In this delicately rendered painting, the old blossoming plum tree appears almost as if enveloped in mist and shrouded in silvery moonlight. Unlike the rugged, expressive ink plum paintings by Cho Hŭi-ryong (1791-1859), the emphasis in this work is on suggestive description and delicate brushwork-characteristics typical of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Korean paintings of plum blossoms.

The wear and slight damage along the right edge of this painting, combined with absence of damage along the left vertical edge, suggest that it was once part of a folding screen. In that context, it is possible that the painting was salvaged from a damaged screen and subsequently mounted as a hanging scroll. One can imagine that the painting originally was one of six or eight panels, each of which represented an old plum tree.

Orchid and Rock,Kim Ŭng-wŏn (also spelled Gim Eung'won; also known as So-ho and Ch'ŏn-ram),late 19th-early 20th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:71981_dynmc,"An important painter and calligrapher of the late Chosŏn period, Kim Ŭng-wŏn is best remembered for his depictions of orchids, which he painted in the manner of the nineteenth-century master Prince Yi Ha-ŭng. (A magnificent screen by Prince Yi Ha-ŭng is featured in this gallery's glass-fronted screen case.) A professor of painting and calligraphy at the Institute of Arts in Seoul, Kim was also one of the founders of the Painting and Calligraphy Association, established in 1918. 

The orchid, a symbol of loyalty and personal integrity, held a fascination for literati painters, since its grasslike leaves and delicate, simple flowers lent themselves to depiction with calligraphic brushwork. Chinese artists had begun to paint the orchid during the Song dynasty (960-1279), the subject becoming ever more popular in the succeeding Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. By the eighteenth century, the taste for paintings of orchids had spread to Korea, where these works enjoyed considerable vogue in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. 

Chinese and Korean artists typically paired orchids and rocks, the orchids coaxing the artist to employ his most delicate, curvilinear brushwork, the rocks tempting him to present his most forceful and expressionistic brushwork. The inscription on this painting translates as:

While sitting quietly, I sense a subtle fragrance.
Such subtlety exists only between reality and imagination.

Untitled,Rudolf de Crignis,1999,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:71931_dynmc,"The canvas has several layers of white gesso, each of which is sanded to achieve a smooth ground. The artist applies the gesso ground around the outer edges of the stretcher, so that the painted surface appears to be floating on a smooth white porcelain block. He applies color in thin layers of glaze, like so many veils. As many as 40 layers of glaze are built up over a period of several weeks. Laying down even, continuous brushstrokes in alternating layers of vertical and horizontal orientations, he creates a subtle grid pattern. The artist often applies one or more colors in addition to blue -- in this case, 6-8 layers of cinnabar green at different depths (traces of which can be seen around the edges of the painting). Layers of ultramarine in combination with royal blue (a mixture of ultramarine and titanium white) make the other colors vibrate, acting ""as a catalyst to bring the involved colors into spacious movement on the top of the surface."" (See artist's statement in object file.) The surface texture is purely the result of brushwork, which creates a structural discipline that interacts with the expansive dematerialized sensuality of blue.

Orchids and Rocks,Yi Ha-ŭng (also known as Taewŏn’gun),dated early autumn 1892,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:51772_dynmc,"A royal prince, Yi Ha-ŭng was the father of King Ko-chong (r. 1864-1906), the last king of the Chosŏn dynasty (1392-1910). In addition to being an enlightened statesman, Yi was an accomplished painter and calligrapher who was unsurpassed in his mastery of orchid painting. Frequently depicted in literati paintings alongside rocks and boulders, the orchid appears graceful, elegant, and unaffected by its rough surroundings. The orchids and rocks in Yi's paintings typically enter the composition at dramatic angles and generally occupy only one corner or one side of a composition. 

Korean folding screens often have six panels, like those painted in Japan; more characteristically, however, Korean screens boast eight, ten, or even twelve panels. In some cases, a Korean screen may feature a single, unified composition that spreads across all its panels; in other instances--such as this one--each panel is conceived as an individual painting. The ten separate paintings that compose this screen are grouped in four pairs, with an individual composition mounted on the first and last panels of the screen. Each of the four pairs in the middle can be read as a single composition or as two separate paintings. Such visual double entendres held a special allure for Korean literati artists of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. This screen's large size and its royal authorship indicate that it was painted for one of the royal palaces.

Each painting bears a personal seal of the artist, rather than a seal with the artist's name or sobriquet. For example, the seal in the lower right corner of the ninth panel (second from the left) translates into the aphorism ""The best time to view a flower is when it is half open."" The other nine personal seal impressions vary from idiomatic phrases to humorous remarks on Daoism and Buddhism. In the very last panel at the far left, however, Yi Ha-ŭng signs and impresses two of his artist's seals to the painting, making the authorship of this important screen indisputable. His inscription translates as, ""Done by the seventy-three-year-old old man Sŏk-p'a in the early autumn of 1892.""

Bamboo through the Four Seasons,Yu Tŏk-chang (also known as Su-un and Ka-san-ŭng),mid 18th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:51495_dynmc,"Korean folding screens often have six panels, like those painted in Japan; more characteristically, however, Korean screens boast eight, ten, or even twelve panels. In some cases, a Korean screen may feature a single, unified composition that spreads across all its panels; in other instances--such as this one--each panel is conceived as an individual painting.

Representing bamboo through the four seasons, this eight-panel screen is meant to be ""read"" by the viewer from right to left. The first two paintings, at the far right, depict newly sprung shoots and fresh stalks of bamboo emerging from the ground in spring. The next pair of images display lush, hearty stalks of bamboo enduring the strong winds and warm sun of summer. The relative sparseness, dry ink tones, and overlapping mist visible in the next two paintings convey characteristics of the autumn months. The last pair of images, at the far left, which depict old, thick, broken stalks of bamboo with hints of new stalks in one painting and bamboo branches heavily laden with snow in the other, complete the cycle with the winter season. Though the paintings lack inscriptions and signatures, two red, square seal impressions at the upper left corner of the far--left panel identify two sobriquets of the artist Yu Tŏk-chang (1675-1765) and thus reveal the creator of this masterful work of art.

A follower of the famous Korean bamboo-painting master Yi Chŏng (1541-1622), Yu Tŏk-chang was one of the most prominent literati artists of the Chosŏn dynasty (1392-1910). Like their Koryŏ-dynasty (918-1392) predecessors, both Yi and Yu took inspiration from the work of Chinese literati painters of the Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1279-1368) dynasties. Their paintings thus tend to resemble literati paintings by early Chinese masters, rather than works produced by their Chinese contemporaries. In this screen, however, Yu departs from the Chinese model and exhibits the distinctly Korean style of bamboo painting he learned from Yi Chŏng: the two tones of ink used to starkly distinguish fore-and background subjects; the angular mists that abruptly interrupt a scene; and the thick stumps of bamboo with sharp, broken edges. 

Bamboo painting was extremely popular among the literati, perhaps because of its association with the so-called Four Gentlemen--plum blossoms, orchids, chrysanthemums, and bamboo. All four of these botanical subjects, which readily lend themselves to depiction with calligraphic brushwork, are said to embody the virtues to which Confucian scholars aspired, such as integrity, purity, and strength in the face of adversity. So important was the ability to paint bamboo that in the fifteenth century it outranked even landscape painting in the official examinations for Korea's royal painting academy.

Portrait of a Youth,Unknown Artist,mid 19th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:789233,"The composition of this portrait study was first outlined in pencil and then blocked out with fields of watercolor, as is evidenced in the sitter’s chair. Next, the artist added opaque watercolor in layers, using fine lines and stippling to replicate the designs and textures of fabrics, most prominently those of the young man’s patterned coat and its gray fur trim. In contrast to his brightly colored clothing, his face is generally pallid, but blues beneath his chin and mouth suggest the hint of a beard. The play on near monochrome is continued in the silhouetted, inky locks that frame his face and give way to a tall black hat. The subject’s position in the composition and aspects of painterly execution such as the modeling of his face and hands suggest that the image was based at least in part on a photograph, a practice common among Qajar artists from the mid-nineteenth century onward, photography having been introduced in Iran in the 1840s. The painting reflects the “new realism” introduced by Abu'l-Hasan Ghaffari, also known as Sani' al-Mulk, in the middle years of the nineteenth century, during the reign of Nasir al-Din Shah (r. 1848–96), and disseminated by his contemporaries. Ghaffari’s work combined physiognomic likeness with the psychology of the subject to produce an often intense pictorial effect—a “real” presence—undiminished by rich decorative details, which in some artists’ hands might emphasize surface at the expense of illusionistic volume and depth. Although this portrait lacks the overall impact of a work by Ghaffari, it demonstrates its painter’s participation in what was new at the time.
On the lower right side of the sheet, a barely visible inscription, which reads, tasvvr-i dukhtar-i Shahrukh (depiction [by] the daughter of Shahrukh), is tantalizing because it suggests a female artist.

Kingfisher Over a Lotus Pond,Ren Yi 任頤,late 19th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:78690_dynmc,"Ren Yi (also known by his sobriquet Bonian) was born in Shangyin (modern Shaoxing), Zhejiang province. The son of a portrait painter, Ren Yi learned to paint at a young age and in adulthood used his art as his livelihood. After living for a time in Ningbo and Suzhou, Ren finally settled in the newly developed port city of Shanghai in 1868. From his base in bustling Shanghai, Ren Yi developed a new and novel style of painting that won him a wide audience and made him the acknowledged leader of the Shanghai school, or Haipai. Though it favors light colors, Ren's style is at once bold, forceful, and vivid, as exemplified by this delightful bird-and-flower painting.

Depicting a small bird with outstretched wings darting through the attenuated stems of lotus growing in a pond, this painting adopts a perspective that brings the viewer down to the water's surface, virtually eye-to-eye with the tiny creature. The broad, blue-green lotus leaves and lush white blossoms appear enormous as they loom above the bird, while a thick forest of lotus stems nearly camouflages it altogether. Faint brush strokes representing water reeds and grasses delineate the pond's surface, which would otherwise appear as a void.

The lotus is an important motif in Chinese art that traces its symbolic origins to Buddhism. Because it grows in muddy waters, yet emerges upright, unsullied, fragrant, and beautiful, the lotus became an emblem of purity in Buddhist literature and imagery. The two Chinese terms for lotus--lian and he--are phonetically identical to numerous auspicious phrases, such as love and harmony, and are thus ubiquitous in Chinese folk art and rebuses.

The vertical crease that runs down the center of this plum-blossom painting indicates that it was once part of an accordion-fold album. Now mounted as a hanging scroll, the painting is believed to have originated from an album of sixteen leaves, all by the same artist. The four-character inscription at the lower right of this painting reads Mae-do-in chak (Chinese, Meidaoren zuo), which might be translated ""Made by Mae-do-in"" or ""Made by the Plum Daoist."" While it would seem an entirely appropriate phrase for Cho Hŭi-ryong, Meidaoren is in fact a hao, or sobriquet, of the renowned fourteenth-century Chinese ink plum painter Wu Zhen (1280-1354). Thus, these four characters are not a signature of Cho Hŭi-ryong; rather, they indicate that in painting this album leaf, Cho imitated the style of Wu Zhen. The rugged, expressive brushwork, however, not only marks the painting as a nineteenth-century work, but distinguishes it from paintings done in earlier centuries, which typically would have attempted a more naturalistic depiction using more delicate and descriptive brushwork.

Red Painting,Joseph Marioni,1999,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:60684_dynmc,"The painting is a large, vertical plane of deep mahogany red-brown acrylic, painted in two distinct layers of thick and thinly applied acrylic, beginning with a stain of dark, ""Benzimidazo"" brown, which acts as a primer. Its outer surface of ""Azoic plum brown"" appears tactile and shiny, almost sticky. The layers vary visibly in tonality and density and the plum brown surface begins to gather into extended drips that coalesce in a series of parallel rivulets about halfway down the picture plane; towards the bottom center, it pools into a series of more marked gullies and ridges, pulling apart like a painterly fjord, and lifting, like a skirt, to reveal the stain below. The acrylic also shrinks in along some of the edges, gaining thickness as it does so, and these effects, along with the implied flow of the medium , the ""breathing room"" between the layers, and its orientation and scale, serve to give the painting an anthropomorphic, object quality. The painting entreats one to interact with it as a whole object/image, and not as a picture of assorted forms or things or parts; it also gains considerably when viewed in daylight.

Korean folding screens often have six panels, like those painted in Japan; more characteristically, however, Korean screens boast eight, ten, or even twelve panels. In some cases, a Korean screen may feature a single, unified composition that spreads across all its panels; in other instances--such as this one--each panel is conceived as an individual painting. The ten separate paintings that compose this screen are grouped in four pairs, with an individual composition mounted on the first and last panels of the screen. Each of the four pairs in the middle can be read as a single composition or as two separate paintings. Such visual double entendres held a special allure for Korean literati artists of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. This screen's large size and its royal authorship indicate that it was painted for one of the royal palaces.

Each painting bears a personal seal of the artist, rather than a seal with the artist's name or sobriquet. For example, the seal in the lower right corner of the ninth panel (second from the left) translates into the aphorism ""The best time to view a flower is when it is half open."" The other nine personal seal impressions vary from idiomatic phrases to humorous remarks on Daoism and Buddhism. In the very last panel at the far left, however, Yi Ha-ŭng signs and impresses two of his artist's seals to the painting, making the authorship of this important screen indisputable. His inscription translates as, ""Done by the seventy-three-year-old old man Sŏk-p'a in the early autumn of 1892.""

Untitled,Rudolf de Crignis,1999,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:71931_dynmc,"The canvas has several layers of white gesso, each of which is sanded to achieve a smooth ground.

He applies color in thin layers of glaze, like so many veils. As many as 40 layers of glaze are built up over a period of several weeks. Laying down even, continuous brushstrokes in alternating layers of vertical and horizontal orientations, he creates a subtle grid pattern. The artist often applies one or more colors in addition to blue -- in this case, 6-8 layers of cinnabar green at different depths (traces of which can be seen around the edges of the painting). Layers of ultramarine in combination with royal blue (a mixture of ultramarine and titanium white) make the other colors vibrate, acting ""as a catalyst to bring the involved colors into spacious movement on the top of the surface."" (See artist's statement in object file.) The surface texture is purely the result of brushwork, which creates a structural discipline that interacts with the expansive dematerialized sensuality of blue.

"Blossoming Branch of an Old, Weathered Plum Tree",Unknown Artist,17th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:71986_dynmc,"Because it blooms in winter, even before it dons its leaves and while snow and ice still cover the ground, the Chinese flowering plum (Prunus mume) became a symbol of purity and of strength in the face of adversity; as such, it was popular as both a literary and an artistic motif in China, Korea, and Japan. The plum, together with the orchid, the chrysanthemum, and the bamboo (three other botanical subjects imbued with symbolic Confucian meaning and conducive to depiction with a calligraphy brush and ink), came to be known as the ""Four Gentlemen.""

In this delicately rendered painting, the old blossoming plum tree appears almost as if enveloped in mist and shrouded in silvery moonlight. Unlike the rugged, expressive ink plum paintings by Cho Hŭi-ryong (1791-1859), the emphasis in this work is on suggestive description and delicate brushwork-characteristics typical of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Korean paintings of plum blossoms.

The wear and slight damage along the right edge of this painting, combined with absence of damage along the left vertical edge, suggest that it was once part of a folding screen. In that context, it is possible that the painting was salvaged from a damaged screen and subsequently mounted as a hanging scroll. One can imagine that the painting originally was one of six or eight panels, each of which represented an old plum tree.

Kingfisher Over a Lotus Pond,Ren Yi 任頤,late 19th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:78690_dynmc,"Ren Yi (also known by his sobriquet Bonian) was born in Shangyin (modern Shaoxing), Zhejiang province. The son of a portrait painter, Ren Yi learned to paint at a young age and in adulthood used his art as his livelihood. After living for a time in Ningbo and Suzhou, Ren finally settled in the newly developed port city of Shanghai in 1868. From his base in bustling Shanghai, Ren Yi developed a new and novel style of painting that won him a wide audience and made him the acknowledged leader of the Shanghai school, or Haipai. Though it favors light colors, Ren's style is at once bold, forceful, and vivid, as exemplified by this delightful bird-and-flower painting.

Depicting a small bird with outstretched wings darting through the attenuated stems of lotus growing in a pond, this painting adopts a perspective that brings the viewer down to the water's surface, virtually eye-to-eye with the tiny creature. The broad, blue-green lotus leaves and lush white blossoms appear enormous as they loom above the bird, while a thick forest of lotus stems nearly camouflages it altogether. Faint brush strokes representing water reeds and grasses delineate the pond's surface, which would otherwise appear as a void.

The lotus is an important motif in Chinese art that traces its symbolic origins to Buddhism. Because it grows in muddy waters, yet emerges upright, unsullied, fragrant, and beautiful, the lotus became an emblem of purity in Buddhist literature and imagery. The two Chinese terms for lotus--lian and he--are phonetically identical to numerous auspicious phrases, such as love and harmony, and are thus ubiquitous in Chinese folk art and rebuses.

Bamboo through the Four Seasons,Yu Tŏk-chang (also known as Su-un and Ka-san-ŭng),mid 18th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:51495_dynmc,"Korean folding screens often have six panels, like those painted in Japan; more characteristically, however, Korean screens boast eight, ten, or even twelve panels. In some cases, a Korean screen may feature a single, unified composition that spreads across all its panels; in other instances--such as this one--each panel is conceived as an individual painting.

Representing bamboo through the four seasons, this eight-panel screen is meant to be ""read"" by the viewer from right to left. The first two paintings, at the far right, depict newly sprung shoots and fresh stalks of bamboo emerging from the ground in spring. The next pair of images display lush, hearty stalks of bamboo enduring the strong winds and warm sun of summer. The relative sparseness, dry ink tones, and overlapping mist visible in the next two paintings convey characteristics of the autumn months. The last pair of images, at the far left, which depict old, thick, broken stalks of bamboo with hints of new stalks in one painting and bamboo branches heavily laden with snow in the other, complete the cycle with the winter season. Though the paintings lack inscriptions and signatures, two red, square seal impressions at the upper left corner of the far--left panel identify two sobriquets of the artist Yu Tŏk-chang (1675-1765) and thus reveal the creator of this masterful work of art.

A follower of the famous Korean bamboo-painting master Yi Chŏng (1541-1622), Yu Tŏk-chang was one of the most prominent literati artists of the Chosŏn dynasty (1392-1910). Like their Koryŏ-dynasty (918-1392) predecessors, both Yi and Yu took inspiration from the work of Chinese literati painters of the Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1279-1368) dynasties. Their paintings thus tend to resemble literati paintings by early Chinese masters, rather than works produced by their Chinese contemporaries. In this screen, however, Yu departs from the Chinese model and exhibits the distinctly Korean style of bamboo painting he learned from Yi Chŏng: the two tones of ink used to starkly distinguish fore-and background subjects; the angular mists that abruptly interrupt a scene; and the thick stumps of bamboo with sharp, broken edges. 

Bamboo painting was extremely popular among the literati, perhaps because of its association with the so-called Four Gentlemen--plum blossoms, orchids, chrysanthemums, and bamboo. All four of these botanical subjects, which readily lend themselves to depiction with calligraphic brushwork, are said to embody the virtues to which Confucian scholars aspired, such as integrity, purity, and strength in the face of adversity. So important was the ability to paint bamboo that in the fifteenth century it outranked even landscape painting in the official examinations for Korea's royal painting academy.

The layers vary visibly in tonality and density and the plum brown surface begins to gather into extended drips that coalesce in a series of parallel rivulets about halfway down the picture plane; towards the bottom center, it pools into a series of more marked gullies and ridges, pulling apart like a painterly fjord, and lifting, like a skirt, to reveal the stain below.

Orchid and Rock,Kim Ŭng-wŏn (also spelled Gim Eung'won; also known as So-ho and Ch'ŏn-ram),late 19th-early 20th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:71981_dynmc,"An important painter and calligrapher of the late Chosŏn period, Kim Ŭng-wŏn is best remembered for his depictions of orchids, which he painted in the manner of the nineteenth-century master Prince Yi Ha-ŭng. (A magnificent screen by Prince Yi Ha-ŭng is featured in this gallery's glass-fronted screen case.) A professor of painting and calligraphy at the Institute of Arts in Seoul, Kim was also one of the founders of the Painting and Calligraphy Association, established in 1918. 

The orchid, a symbol of loyalty and personal integrity, held a fascination for literati painters, since its grasslike leaves and delicate, simple flowers lent themselves to depiction with calligraphic brushwork. Chinese artists had begun to paint the orchid during the Song dynasty (960-1279), the subject becoming ever more popular in the succeeding Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. By the eighteenth century, the taste for paintings of orchids had spread to Korea, where these works enjoyed considerable vogue in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. 

Chinese and Korean artists typically paired orchids and rocks, the orchids coaxing the artist to employ his most delicate, curvilinear brushwork, the rocks tempting him to present his most forceful and expressionistic brushwork. The inscription on this painting translates as:

While sitting quietly, I sense a subtle fragrance.
Such subtlety exists only between reality and imagination.

Untitled,Rudolf de Crignis,1999,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:71931_dynmc,"The canvas has several layers of white gesso, each of which is sanded to achieve a smooth ground. The artist applies the gesso ground around the outer edges of the stretcher, so that the painted surface appears to be floating on a smooth white porcelain block. He applies color in thin layers of glaze, like so many veils. As many as 40 layers of glaze are built up over a period of several weeks. Laying down even, continuous brushstrokes in alternating layers of vertical and horizontal orientations, he creates a subtle grid pattern. The artist often applies one or more colors in addition to blue -- in this case, 6-8 layers of cinnabar green at different depths (traces of which can be seen around the edges of the painting). Layers of ultramarine in combination with royal blue (a mixture of ultramarine and titanium white) make the other colors vibrate, acting ""as a catalyst to bring the involved colors into spacious movement on the top of the surface."" (See artist's statement in object file.) The surface texture is purely the result of brushwork, which creates a structural discipline that interacts with the expansive dematerialized sensuality of blue.

"Blossoming Branch of an Old, Weathered Plum Tree",Unknown Artist,17th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:71986_dynmc,"Because it blooms in winter, even before it dons its leaves and while snow and ice still cover the ground, the Chinese flowering plum (Prunus mume) became a symbol of purity and of strength in the face of adversity; as such, it was popular as both a literary and an artistic motif in China, Korea, and Japan. The plum, together with the orchid, the chrysanthemum, and the bamboo (three other botanical subjects imbued with symbolic Confucian meaning and conducive to depiction with a calligraphy brush and ink), came to be known as the ""Four Gentlemen.""

In this delicately rendered painting, the old blossoming plum tree appears almost as if enveloped in mist and shrouded in silvery moonlight. Unlike the rugged, expressive ink plum paintings by Cho Hŭi-ryong (1791-1859), the emphasis in this work is on suggestive description and delicate brushwork-characteristics typical of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Korean paintings of plum blossoms.

The wear and slight damage along the right edge of this painting, combined with absence of damage along the left vertical edge, suggest that it was once part of a folding screen. In that context, it is possible that the painting was salvaged from a damaged screen and subsequently mounted as a hanging scroll. One can imagine that the painting originally was one of six or eight panels, each of which represented an old plum tree.

Bamboo through the Four Seasons,Yu Tŏk-chang (also known as Su-un and Ka-san-ŭng),mid 18th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:51495_dynmc,"Korean folding screens often have six panels, like those painted in Japan; more characteristically, however, Korean screens boast eight, ten, or even twelve panels. In some cases, a Korean screen may feature a single, unified composition that spreads across all its panels; in other instances--such as this one--each panel is conceived as an individual painting.

Representing bamboo through the four seasons, this eight-panel screen is meant to be ""read"" by the viewer from right to left. The first two paintings, at the far right, depict newly sprung shoots and fresh stalks of bamboo emerging from the ground in spring. The next pair of images display lush, hearty stalks of bamboo enduring the strong winds and warm sun of summer. The relative sparseness, dry ink tones, and overlapping mist visible in the next two paintings convey characteristics of the autumn months. The last pair of images, at the far left, which depict old, thick, broken stalks of bamboo with hints of new stalks in one painting and bamboo branches heavily laden with snow in the other, complete the cycle with the winter season. Though the paintings lack inscriptions and signatures, two red, square seal impressions at the upper left corner of the far--left panel identify two sobriquets of the artist Yu Tŏk-chang (1675-1765) and thus reveal the creator of this masterful work of art.

A follower of the famous Korean bamboo-painting master Yi Chŏng (1541-1622), Yu Tŏk-chang was one of the most prominent literati artists of the Chosŏn dynasty (1392-1910). Like their Koryŏ-dynasty (918-1392) predecessors, both Yi and Yu took inspiration from the work of Chinese literati painters of the Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1279-1368) dynasties. Their paintings thus tend to resemble literati paintings by early Chinese masters, rather than works produced by their Chinese contemporaries. In this screen, however, Yu departs from the Chinese model and exhibits the distinctly Korean style of bamboo painting he learned from Yi Chŏng: the two tones of ink used to starkly distinguish fore-and background subjects; the angular mists that abruptly interrupt a scene; and the thick stumps of bamboo with sharp, broken edges. 

Bamboo painting was extremely popular among the literati, perhaps because of its association with the so-called Four Gentlemen--plum blossoms, orchids, chrysanthemums, and bamboo. All four of these botanical subjects, which readily lend themselves to depiction with calligraphic brushwork, are said to embody the virtues to which Confucian scholars aspired, such as integrity, purity, and strength in the face of adversity. So important was the ability to paint bamboo that in the fifteenth century it outranked even landscape painting in the official examinations for Korea's royal painting academy.

Kingfisher Over a Lotus Pond,Ren Yi 任頤,late 19th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:78690_dynmc,"Ren Yi (also known by his sobriquet Bonian) was born in Shangyin (modern Shaoxing), Zhejiang province. The son of a portrait painter, Ren Yi learned to paint at a young age and in adulthood used his art as his livelihood. After living for a time in Ningbo and Suzhou, Ren finally settled in the newly developed port city of Shanghai in 1868. From his base in bustling Shanghai, Ren Yi developed a new and novel style of painting that won him a wide audience and made him the acknowledged leader of the Shanghai school, or Haipai. Though it favors light colors, Ren's style is at once bold, forceful, and vivid, as exemplified by this delightful bird-and-flower painting.

Depicting a small bird with outstretched wings darting through the attenuated stems of lotus growing in a pond, this painting adopts a perspective that brings the viewer down to the water's surface, virtually eye-to-eye with the tiny creature. The broad, blue-green lotus leaves and lush white blossoms appear enormous as they loom above the bird, while a thick forest of lotus stems nearly camouflages it altogether. Faint brush strokes representing water reeds and grasses delineate the pond's surface, which would otherwise appear as a void.

The lotus is an important motif in Chinese art that traces its symbolic origins to Buddhism. Because it grows in muddy waters, yet emerges upright, unsullied, fragrant, and beautiful, the lotus became an emblem of purity in Buddhist literature and imagery. The two Chinese terms for lotus--lian and he--are phonetically identical to numerous auspicious phrases, such as love and harmony, and are thus ubiquitous in Chinese folk art and rebuses.

Portrait of a Youth,Unknown Artist,mid 19th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:789233,"The composition of this portrait study was first outlined in pencil and then blocked out with fields of watercolor, as is evidenced in the sitter’s chair. Next, the artist added opaque watercolor in layers, using fine lines and stippling to replicate the designs and textures of fabrics, most prominently those of the young man’s patterned coat and its gray fur trim. In contrast to his brightly colored clothing, his face is generally pallid, but blues beneath his chin and mouth suggest the hint of a beard. The play on near monochrome is continued in the silhouetted, inky locks that frame his face and give way to a tall black hat. The subject’s position in the composition and aspects of painterly execution such as the modeling of his face and hands suggest that the image was based at least in part on a photograph, a practice common among Qajar artists from the mid-nineteenth century onward, photography having been introduced in Iran in the 1840s. The painting reflects the “new realism” introduced by Abu'l-Hasan Ghaffari, also known as Sani' al-Mulk, in the middle years of the nineteenth century, during the reign of Nasir al-Din Shah (r. 1848–96), and disseminated by his contemporaries. Ghaffari’s work combined physiognomic likeness with the psychology of the subject to produce an often intense pictorial effect—a “real” presence—undiminished by rich decorative details, which in some artists’ hands might emphasize surface at the expense of illusionistic volume and depth. Although this portrait lacks the overall impact of a work by Ghaffari, it demonstrates its painter’s participation in what was new at the time.
On the lower right side of the sheet, a barely visible inscription, which reads, tasvvr-i dukhtar-i Shahrukh (depiction [by] the daughter of Shahrukh), is tantalizing because it suggests a female artist. Unfortunately, however, this notation is too perfunctory and too uncertain in date to permit further conclusions.",2281.05

Orchids and Rocks,Yi Ha-ŭng (also known as Taewŏn’gun),dated early autumn 1892,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:51772_dynmc,"A royal prince, Yi Ha-ŭng was the father of King Ko-chong (r. 1864-1906), the last king of the Chosŏn dynasty (1392-1910). In addition to being an enlightened statesman, Yi was an accomplished painter and calligrapher who was unsurpassed in his mastery of orchid painting. Frequently depicted in literati paintings alongside rocks and boulders, the orchid appears graceful, elegant, and unaffected by its rough surroundings. The orchids and rocks in Yi's paintings typically enter the composition at dramatic angles and generally occupy only one corner or one side of a composition. 

Korean folding screens often have six panels, like those painted in Japan; more characteristically, however, Korean screens boast eight, ten, or even twelve panels. In some cases, a Korean screen may feature a single, unified composition that spreads across all its panels; in other instances--such as this one--each panel is conceived as an individual painting. The ten separate paintings that compose this screen are grouped in four pairs, with an individual composition mounted on the first and last panels of the screen. Each of the four pairs in the middle can be read as a single composition or as two separate paintings. Such visual double entendres held a special allure for Korean literati artists of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. This screen's large size and its royal authorship indicate that it was painted for one of the royal palaces.

Each painting bears a personal seal of the artist, rather than a seal with the artist's name or sobriquet. For example, the seal in the lower right corner of the ninth panel (second from the left) translates into the aphorism ""The best time to view a flower is when it is half open."" The other nine personal seal impressions vary from idiomatic phrases to humorous remarks on Daoism and Buddhism. In the very last panel at the far left, however, Yi Ha-ŭng signs and impresses two of his artist's seals to the painting, making the authorship of this important screen indisputable. His inscription translates as, ""Done by the seventy-three-year-old old man Sŏk-p'a in the early autumn of 1892.""

Hibiscus Flowers and Wild Pinks,Kitagawa Sōsetsu 喜多川相説,"Early Edo period, mid 17th century",,"This painting depicts two seasonal flowers in an abstract and yet naturalistic composition; upright floral silhouettes rise gracefully from shadowy or imperceptible roots in a strikingly decorative design devoid of any visible ground plane. Individual plant forms are defined using a technique known as tarashikomi, in which black ink and/or mineral pigments have been splashed onto areas of still-moist ink wash, resulting in evocative pools of saturation. The evolution of such seemingly effortless and yet technically difficult decorative imagery also found expression in many other media during the Edo period (1615-1868), so that divisions between the various arts--such as painting, lacquerware, and metalwork--began to blur. Tarashikomi is one of the hallmarks of so-called Rimpa-style paintings--works done in emulation of Tawaraya Sōtatsu (died c. 1643), who is credited with having consciously evoked and updated the rich, allusive imagery of Japan's Heian-period (794-1185) past. The artist to whom this painting is attributed, Kitagawa Sōsetsu, appears to have been an accomplished and faithful mid-seventeenth-century follower in the direct line of Sōtatsu; however, many questions remain regarding Sōsetsu's identity and oeuvre. This work is likely one of a set of paintings depicting either the Flowers of the Twelve Months or the Flowers of the Four Seasons.",3002.94

The goddess is frontal, wearing a straight wig, parted in the center, and bound with straight ribbons. Her triangle shaped face is flat with wide-set eyes, broad cheeks, and a flat chin. Her characteristically cow-shaped ears are rendered as flat on either side of the wig. Below her face is a round broad collar with a simple pattern of tube and drop beads. On each of her shoulder sits a uraeus, the upright rearing cobra, holding a sun-disk on its head.  A molded cornice above the goddess’ head holds the lower part of the architectural frame of the naos, or temple, within which sits a uraeus. The main part of the naos, which would have extended upwards to form the remainder of the structure, is now lost. The emblem would have been attached to a handle, also lost, that may have included inscriptions to a pharaoh.",6175.23

Illustrated manuscript of the Hadiqat al-Su'ada (Garden of the Blessed) by Fuzuli,Unknown Artist,c. 1575,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC239431_dynmc,"This is an illustrated copy of Hadikat al-Su'ada of Fuzuli who in his own words wrote it under the grace of an Ottoman official during the reign of the Ottoman sultan, Suleyman the Magnificent (1520-1566) in or before 1547. The text in Azeri Turkish concerns the hardships endured by Prophet Muhammad and his family, especially his grandsons' death in Karbala, Iraq where the author Fuzuli was from. The manuscript is copied in 19 lines of naskh on 167 folios. There are notes and description of miniatures in Turkish in a later hand. There are four paintings:
1) 67v: Hasan and Husayn mourn as their father Ali is struck down by Ibn Muljan.
2) 77r: The poisoning of Hasan. 
3) 100v: Young martyrs, Hasan and Husayn, hold up their heads after decapitation at the hands of the military governor of Kufa in 680.
4)145r: Devotion paid to the horse of martyr Husayn upon its return to camp.
All the miniatures are text block size and horizontal ones force the viewer to turn the book for better viewing. Although the mosque depiction on the first miniature suggests an Ottoman context, the illustrative style, the colors of the miniatures, especially lilac and orange, and the overall quality of the manuscript suggest that it was not produced in the palace workshops.",9663.24
