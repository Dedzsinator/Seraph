"Old Weathered Plum Tree with Spring Blossoms, in the Manner of the Chinese Painter Wu Zhen (1280-1354)",Cho Hŭi-ryong,mid-19th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:71985_dynmc,"This plum-blossom painting is an expressive combination of balanced contrasts: soft, rounded plum blossoms and buds delicately rest on sharp branches that burst in every direction; watery ink washes are punctuated with black dots scattered along the image. 

The vertical crease that runs down the center of this plum-blossom painting indicates that it was once part of an accordion-fold album. Now mounted as a hanging scroll, the painting is believed to have originated from an album of sixteen leaves, all by the same artist. The four-character inscription at the lower right of this painting reads Mae-do-in chak (Chinese, Meidaoren zuo), which might be translated ""Made by Mae-do-in"" or ""Made by the Plum Daoist."" While it would seem an entirely appropriate phrase for Cho Hŭi-ryong, Meidaoren is in fact a hao, or sobriquet, of the renowned fourteenth-century Chinese ink plum painter Wu Zhen (1280-1354). Thus, these four characters are not a signature of Cho Hŭi-ryong; rather, they indicate that in painting this album leaf, Cho imitated the style of Wu Zhen. The rugged, expressive brushwork, however, not only marks the painting as a nineteenth-century work, but distinguishes it from paintings done in earlier centuries, which typically would have attempted a more naturalistic depiction using more delicate and descriptive brushwork.

Orchid and Rock,Kim Ŭng-wŏn (also spelled Gim Eung'won; also known as So-ho and Ch'ŏn-ram),late 19th-early 20th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:71981_dynmc,"An important painter and calligrapher of the late Chosŏn period, Kim Ŭng-wŏn is best remembered for his depictions of orchids, which he painted in the manner of the nineteenth-century master Prince Yi Ha-ŭng. (A magnificent screen by Prince Yi Ha-ŭng is featured in this gallery's glass-fronted screen case.) A professor of painting and calligraphy at the Institute of Arts in Seoul, Kim was also one of the founders of the Painting and Calligraphy Association, established in 1918. 

The orchid, a symbol of loyalty and personal integrity, held a fascination for literati painters, since its grasslike leaves and delicate, simple flowers lent themselves to depiction with calligraphic brushwork. Chinese artists had begun to paint the orchid during the Song dynasty (960-1279), the subject becoming ever more popular in the succeeding Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. By the eighteenth century, the taste for paintings of orchids had spread to Korea, where these works enjoyed considerable vogue in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. 

Chinese and Korean artists typically paired orchids and rocks, the orchids coaxing the artist to employ his most delicate, curvilinear brushwork, the rocks tempting him to present his most forceful and expressionistic brushwork. The inscription on this painting translates as:

While sitting quietly, I sense a subtle fragrance.
Such subtlety exists only between reality and imagination.

Portrait of a Youth,Unknown Artist,mid 19th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:789233,"The composition of this portrait study was first outlined in pencil and then blocked out with fields of watercolor, as is evidenced in the sitter’s chair. Next, the artist added opaque watercolor in layers, using fine lines and stippling to replicate the designs and textures of fabrics, most prominently those of the young man’s patterned coat and its gray fur trim. In contrast to his brightly colored clothing, his face is generally pallid, but blues beneath his chin and mouth suggest the hint of a beard. The play on near monochrome is continued in the silhouetted, inky locks that frame his face and give way to a tall black hat. The subject’s position in the composition and aspects of painterly execution such as the modeling of his face and hands suggest that the image was based at least in part on a photograph, a practice common among Qajar artists from the mid-nineteenth century onward, photography having been introduced in Iran in the 1840s. The painting reflects the “new realism” introduced by Abu'l-Hasan Ghaffari, also known as Sani' al-Mulk, in the middle years of the nineteenth century, during the reign of Nasir al-Din Shah (r. 1848–96), and disseminated by his contemporaries. Ghaffari’s work combined physiognomic likeness with the psychology of the subject to produce an often intense pictorial effect—a “real” presence—undiminished by rich decorative details, which in some artists’ hands might emphasize surface at the expense of illusionistic volume and depth. Although this portrait lacks the overall impact of a work by Ghaffari, it demonstrates its painter’s participation in what was new at the time.
On the lower right side of the sheet, a barely visible inscription, which reads, tasvvr-i dukhtar-i Shahrukh (depiction [by] the daughter of Shahrukh), is tantalizing because it suggests a female artist.

"Old Weathered Plum Tree with Spring Blossoms, in the Manner of the Chinese Painter Wu Zhen (1280-1354)",Cho Hŭi-ryong,mid-19th century,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:71985_dynmc,"This plum-blossom painting is an expressive combination of balanced contrasts: soft, rounded plum blossoms and buds delicately rest on sharp branches that burst in every direction; watery ink washes are punctuated with black dots scattered along the image. 

The vertical crease that runs down the center of this plum-blossom painting indicates that it was once part of an accordion-fold album. Now mounted as a hanging scroll, the painting is believed to have originated from an album of sixteen leaves, all by the same artist. The four-character inscription at the lower right of this painting reads Mae-do-in chak (Chinese, Meidaoren zuo), which might be translated ""Made by Mae-do-in"" or ""Made by the Plum Daoist."" While it would seem an entirely appropriate phrase for Cho Hŭi-ryong, Meidaoren is in fact a hao, or sobriquet, of the renowned fourteenth-century Chinese ink plum painter Wu Zhen (1280-1354). Thus, these four characters are not a signature of Cho Hŭi-ryong; rather, they indicate that in painting this album leaf, Cho imitated the style of Wu Zhen. The rugged, expressive brushwork, however, not only marks the painting as a nineteenth-century work, but distinguishes it from paintings done in earlier centuries, which typically would have attempted a more naturalistic depiction using more delicate and descriptive brushwork.

It was written in Turkish by a Turkish poet (Darir of Erzurum) in Cairo for the Mamluk sultan of Egypt in 1388. Enjoyed among court circles, the Ottoman sultan Murad III (r. 1574-1595) commissioned a multi-volume imperial copy with 814 illustrations in the 1590s. It was expertly copied and illustrated by Ottoman court artists. This scene depicts the Prophet at a feast with his companions during military campaigns around the port city of Yanbu, in present-day Saudi Arabia. In the miniature following 16th century norms, the face of the Prophet is covered and the flaming halo around his body indicates his prophetic status. The artist chose contemporary Ottoman details, such as blue-and-white ceramic dishes and gilded tableware along with architectural details, to visualize the actual setting of the event that took place in 623.",5180.13
